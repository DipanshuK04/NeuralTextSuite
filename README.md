# Neural Text Suite
**RNN-based QA prediction & Next-Word Prediction (LSTM)**

Neural Text Suite is a compact research / demo codebase that implements two NLP models:
1. **RNN-based QA prediction** — sequence model that scores/generates short answers given a question (RNN/LSTM variants supported).  
2. **Next-word prediction** — a language model using stacked LSTMs for token-level next-word prediction and sampling.

## Key features
- Clean, minimal PyTorch implementation (train / eval / inference).
- Utilities for tokenization, batching, sampling, and evaluation (accuracy, perplexity, F1 for QA).
